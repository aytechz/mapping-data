Typically Roussanne, which is more difficult to ripen and thus more rare, takes a backseat to the Grenache Blanc, which is a more neutral tasting grape.  We like to richen up this blend a bit and include more of the robust Roussanne.  The resulting blend is nearly a 50-50 balance between the two varieties.  The grapes were whole cluster pressed and then fermented and aged together in a small, temperature controlled stainless tank.  This early blending allowed the flavors to come together more completely.  After fermentation, the wine was transferred to neutral French Burgundy barrels to allow a bit more oxygen into the wine, which acted to soften and round out the final wine.  The aroma of this wine explodes with white flowers, green apple, a tropical\/banana note, and a flinty\/minerally note.  The aromas find their way onto the palate where you will sense a long, round, viscous mouthfeel made complex with a racy acidity.  The RGB is clean, fresh, and ready to drink.

The newer Chardonnay clones planted at Le Bon Climat in 1998 have riper flavors at lower sugars when compared to the UC Davis clones. 2006 was a cool vintage, the grapes for this wine were picked nearly two weeks later than normal. The final blend is 2\/3 Bien Nacido and 1\/3 Le Bon Climat. This is the richest and roundest of all the Au Bon Climat Chardonnays. Don't be fooled by the upfront flavors, the finish is bright with palette cleansing acidity."}

The 99 Pac Rim is a bit of a breakthrough.  Firstly, we have allowed just the teensiest bit of residual sugar to repose in the finished wine - \"letting love in,\" as it were, in the parlance of my twin-brother-seperated-at-birth, Terry Theise.  We contrived to boost the acid a little bit, picking the grapes a little earlier and the result is a fresher, more vibrant wine with greater retention of primary fruit.  And as an added bonus and at no extra charge, the wine actually seems to work far better with sushi and other umami-intensive cuisine that Pac Rims pasado.

It started early, stayed late, and along the way brought upside down weather patterns that found days warm when they should be cool, and cool when they should be warm. Bud break for Chardonnay began to creep out in the warmest hillsides in February following an exceptionally mild winter. We had rain and cold in April, warm May days, showers in June and thunderstorms in July. Go figure. While we worried about rain during harvest, we found instead a beautiful Indian Summer that let grapes hang and develop full flavors, with higher acids that lead to this vintage having a bright, crisp showing that should be very pleasing. Flavors were even more concentrated as most vineyards found yields for Chardonnay 20-30% below average, allowing vines to concentrate energy in the fruit. Judicious shoot thinning and the careful eye that comes with organic farming led, in the end, to one of the most memorable vintages of the new century so far. "}

Instead the vines are trained into basket shapes and the grapes are grown in the protective center of the basket.  Some vines are over 200 years old and form giant baskets.  The wines of Santorini are made from the Assyrtiko (a-SEER-tee-ko) grape, which has the unique ability to maintain its fresh, citrusy flavors despite the extreme conditions that would make other grapes overripe.

It also \u201clooks like the vine is throwing its arms up toward the sun,\u201d says Willi (poetically!), who adds, \u201cAnd it shows that you don\u2019t need old vines to give great Riesling.\u201d I show you the \u201914 basically for-the-record, as it won\u2019t be released until 2016, not to mention any sensible person would jump on the grandiose 2013. I\u2019m starting to sense that Lyra is a music that\u2019s begun to write itself. Willi\u2019s early goal was to show the utmost rapture of fruit, as an alpha to the omega of the Alte Reben and its darker gravitas. But for the last three vintages, Lyra has become almost overwhelmingly beautiful. It isn\u2019t just fruit any more, and what began as a rapture has changed to a kind of apotheosis of fruit toward a gleaming and complicated divinity. The wine remains ecstatic, but these things are never earned easily. \u201913 is graceful and massive, dense and weightless, a whirligig of complexity in which a hundred elements glide in an esoteric dance, moving quickly, stepping lightly; it has the focus and the beatific glow of Alzinger (and his wines!), somehow both serene and hyperactively intricate. The \u201914 Lyra, which we\u2019ll see in January 2016, is really green and herbal; it has its usual beaming countenance but in a different key than usual, like a parfait of each green leaf."}

{"Unnamed: 0":7680,"name":"Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc 2010","grape":null,"region":"Napa Valley, California","variety":"White Wine","rating":91.0,"notes":"We harvest our Sauvignon Blanc grapes at night, when the vines are in full repose, to fully capture their fresh, concentrated varietal flavors, crisp acidity and ideal sugar-acid balance. Whole-cluster-pressing of the fruit immediately upon arrival at the winery maximizes varietal intensity while minimizing the extraction of astringent compounds from the skins. In 2010, we tank-fermented 88% of the juice while fermenting 12% in neutral oak barrels. Subsequently, 87% of the wine spent five months aging in neutral French oak barrels, which enriched its texture while optimizing varietal expression.  Due to the coolness of the vintage, our 2010 Sauvignon Blanc is especially fresh, crisp and vibrant, offering bright honeydew melon, pink grapefruit, gooseberry and vanilla aromas and rich, mouthwatering, citrus, nectarine and melon flavors. An ideal ap\u00e8ritif wine, it also beautifully accompanies a wide and diverse range of foods, from shellfish and lighter seafood dishes to roast chicken, Caesar Salad and pasta primavera. "}

When all is said and done, Catena Zapata is the Argentina winery of reference \u2013 the standard of excellence for comparing all others. The brilliant, forward-thinking Nicolas Catena remains in charge, with his daughter, Laura, playing an increasingly large role. The Catena Zapata winery is an essential destination for fans of both architecture and wine in Mendoza. It is hard to believe, given the surge in popularity of Malbec in recent years, that Catena Zapata only began exporting Malbec to the United States in 1994.\""}

In the vineyards we carefully manage the vine canopy to expose the fruit to filtered sunlight. This is achieved by careful hand leaf removal in the fruit zone combined with cluster thinning. The result is both fully and evenly ripened grapes. This wine is a blend of nine different clones of Sauvignon blanc and two clones of Sauvignon gris grown on the Estate. Sauvignon gris' ripe stone fruit flavors plus its weight and texture provide a pleasing counterpoint to the more bright tropical and citrus aspects of the other Sauvignon blanc clones. f Throughout harvest and vinification exposure to air is minimized. One third of the lots are given skin contact before pressing. This increases the concentration of the aromatic compounds associated with the intense aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit. The wine is entirely barrel fermented in a combination of small French oak and stainless steel barrels. Although primarily fermented with native yeast, the skin-contact lots were inoculated with strains of yeast which assist in the release of the ripe aromatic compounds of this variety. f B\u00e2tonnage, or lees stirring, continues regularly during and after fermentation to add a soft creamy element to the texture of the wine. After nine months in the barrel various lots were blended and then bottled without filtration. f This wine has an abundance of tropical and citrus elements on the nose and palate.

There is little morning or afternoon sun, and moisture burns off slowly late in the season. After the grapes are fully ripe, light rainfall encourages botrytis development. When this is followed by a period of warm, dry weather the fruit is dessicated, concentrating the acid and sugar.

But white Le Poste holds a very special place at Saint Cosme. When my parents met, in 1956, my father arrived at Saint Cosme and only found bottles of white Le Poste wine in the cellar. There were very few bottles of red: my maternal grandfather, who died in 1949, could never explain to him why, because they never knew each other. But it is quite obvious that there has always been a strong \u2018white tradition\u2019 at Saint Cosme. The wines, all of which were pre-1949, were extraordinary according to what my father told me. When he replanted the Le Poste vineyard in 1964, he kept the same proportion of Clairette and Grenache, to perpetuate its history. Our Clairette plantings at Hominis Fides and Le Claux will soon start bearing and write a new chapter in the story of Saint Cosme that we will be able to read together. The application to produce white Gigondas, which we have been supporting for almost 10 years at INAO, is in its final phase. We should reach a successful conclusion in around two years\u2019 time and will finally be able to call Le Poste, along with the other whites produced in Gigondas, \u2018Gigondas\u2019.

Pressing was done as whole clusters, utilizing a membrane press to gently dejuice the grapes without breakage of skins, seeds, or stems.   The juice was settled for 24 hours and racked to barrel for 100% barrel fermentation.  Fermentation was conducted at approximately 55\u00b0 F to promote a long, slow development of the fruit.  Three distinctive yeasts, two isolates from Burgundian cellars and another from Champagne, were used to add complexity.   Upon completion of primary fermentation, the barrels were stirred weekly to promote the breakdown of the yeasts adding additional layers of complexity as well as enhancing the creamy texture of the wine. Malolactic fermentation started at the completion of primary fermentation and continued through February. The wine was aged surlies for 16 months in barrel. This extra time allowed the slowly developing fruit to emerge and further enhance the richness and structure.

The growing season was like 2005 that gave us very ripe tannins and round and supple acidities. The flowering was perfect, which made for a large crop with uniform ripeness levels. And because the growing season didn't have much rot pressure, the fruit was super clean and our sorting losses were less than 5%. We began picking on the 8th of September and started with the whites before moving on to the reds. The fruit averaged 13% in terms of potential alcohol and there wasn't even one wine that I decided to chaptalize, which is extremely rare. The vinification was easy even though I did a relatively long cuvaison of 25 to 28 days at a maximum temperature of 30\u00b0 C. As I did in 2008, I used varying percentages of whole clusters, which I think added elegance. The malos were irregular with some beginning early and finishing late and some started late but finished quickly. The post-malo pHs were in the 3.65 range, which is perfectly acceptable to us. Overall, we are extremely happy with the potential quality of our '09s and believe that our clients are going to love them.\" As I have observed previously, Vincent is making real progress and these '09s are easily the best wines I have yet seen from him, which is a real compliment as the '08s were excellent. Moreover, several of the villages level wines offer truly outstanding quality and should be on your radar screens for obtaining great value."}

Traditionally, Marcoux's white is an unusual blend (in the sense that it was heavily Roussanne dominant) of 60% Roussanne and 40% Bourboulenc hailing from two parcels. The Roussanne's 0.5-hectares of vines in Les Esqueirons where the cool limestone-based soils are perfect for white grapes (bringing freshness, texture and finesse) and the Bourboulenc, a 0.35-hectare plot in Les Bosquets (this variety bringing more citric freshness and drive). From 2015, due to demand for this cuv\u00e9e, Sophie Armenier has been vinifying and blending in Marcoux's white varieties that grow on their 'red' vineyards--Grenache Blanc and Clairette. Pre-2015 these grapes were co-fermented with the estate Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape rouge. Hence, the new blend looks something like this: Roussanne (55%; bringing the power), Bourboulenc (35%; freshness) and Grenache Blanc\/Clairette (10%; flesh and finesse). The grapes are whole-berry pressed, naturally fermented and raised entirely in steel vat on fine lees. There is no b\u00e2tonnage and the malo is blocked to further underline the wine's structure and freshness.

{"Unnamed: 0":22077,"name":"Farella La Luce Estate Sauvignon Blanc 2017","grape":null,"region":"Coombsville, Napa Valley, California","variety":"White Wine","rating":93.0,"notes":"Sauvignon Blanc is one of our favorite refreshments -- crisp, fresh and lively. We have subscribed to this style for 30 years from the same block on our vineyard estate. We keep 15 \u2013 20% of our Sauvignon Blanc grapes, the remainder going to Lail Vineyards, Realm Cellars and Tournesol. Our estate-bottled Sauvignon Blanc bears the name \u201cLa Luce,\u201d an homage to this wine and our Italian heritage, but in particular to our founder, Frank Farella (alive and well!) and his passion for our vineyard and the spectacular sunsets, we enjoy from our west-facing site on an almost daily basis. He produced the first Sauvignon Blanc from our vineyard in 1985. Many Napa Valley Sauvignon Blancs are made with an attempt at richness and complexity but, too often, resulting in wines that are better compared to their Chardonnay cousins. The key to a lively Sauvignon Blanc is harvesting at the lowest sugar level in the ripeness window and a cold fermentation with Champagne yeast below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. We also ferment in a stainless steel tank and minimize the handling of the wine, again to maintain freshness. In the end, our Sauvignon Blanc is best compared to the light, fresh, relatively low alcohol white wines commonly found in Northern Italy. We have been amazed at the ability of those wines to refresh and not dull the senses due to their low alcohol and high acidity. It is difficult to find wines made domestically in this category with any varietal. Since our first vintage, we have produced Sauvignon Blancs that play off of the citrus and light tropical fruit characteristics that are so often overblown in the wide range of styles produced in California. We have sought to enhance the delicacy and refreshment that can make Sauvignon Blanc such a wonderful aperitif to enhance your appetite and enliven your palate. "}

{"Unnamed: 0":26248,"name":"Hanzell Chardonnay 1998","grape":null,"region":"Sonoma County, California","variety":"White Wine","rating":90.0,"notes":"Hanzell Vineyards Chardonnay is rich, but vibrant. In its youth it is filled with the sharp signature of the chardonnay grape: pear, pineapple, citrus, green apple. Also present when young is a steely, minerally quality and bright citrus crispness. As the chardonnay matures it gains nuances of sweet pear, honey, ripe apple, vanilla, hazelnut, smoke, and toasted almond.  The majority of the chardonnay is fermented in custom-made stainless-steel tanks that hold one ton. About 10-20% is fermented in barrels, and aged 10 months sur lie with the lees stirred up to six months. The chardonnay is allowed a short period of skin contact in the one-ton stainless steel fermentation tanks before being pressed. It is transferred into other tanks of various sizes and allowed a period of cold settling prior to being inoculated for fermentation.  Hanzell Vineyards uses almost exclusively Tonnellerie Sirugue barrels from Nuits-St.-Georges, France to age the chardonnay. Approximately 25-40% is allowed to undergo malolactic fermentation on average. The chardonnay ages for one year in barrel, of which 25% are new.  The Vintage:  \"This year's vines started growing rather late because of cool temperatures and robust rain from November through February. It was a steady moderate summer which was mild enough until the end of September and beginning of October. Then for a few days a flash of heat ripened the fruit almost faster than we could pick it, and we finished with very ripe and very flavorful clusters of Chardonnay.\"  Winemaker's Comments:  \"We think our '98 is a stunner. It starts out very brightly in the nose with nice, fruity pear-peach-apple. It's got a very small touch of malolactic influence and then a larger wave of that mineral, almost fruit-like quality that emanates from the lower slopes of the Mayacamas range. Its finish is powerful and stays for the longest time! This seems a particularly powerful expression of the great ancient Burgundy clone of Chardonnay that we grow and cherish at Hanzell.\" "}

Chardonnay is the unique variety used to produce these white wines. It is growing on limestone soil mixed with brown clay.  A careful balance between tradition and modern techniques characterizes Joseph Drouhin vineyard management and vinification : they have their own nursery. Ploughing and leaf removal are the only methods used. The whole harvest is picked by hand. The grapes are gently and slowly pressed. The juice settles down for a few hours and is then placed in oak barrels. The fermentation starts naturally, with no yeast inoculation. The malolactic fermentation is always led to its natural completion. The wine matures in small oak barrels for 9 to 10 months and receives all the necessary care before bottling. The percentage of new oak varies with the vintage, never exceeding 40%, so that the oak cannot dominate the fruit.  Chassagne-Montrachet always has a beautiful, limpid, golden hue. On the nose, there are often delicate nuances of pear, vanilla and almonds flavours. Round and ample on the palate, the wine has length and complexity. It is best served with white meat (turkey, veal) or fish in delicate sauces."}

I think it will probably open up more quickly than the 2007 did.
